* Missing a quick overview of which tasks were not completed (column with done)

##Notes
* ADD
	* See ADD feedback for Sprint 4
	* How have you met you're design goals so far?
	* Sequence diagrams / flow charts of the system would be useful
		* The user starts up the program and then what happens?
		* What happens in the background when the user does certain actions?
* Much better reviewing process, keep it up!
* `graph1.js` is not a proper name
* `time.js` is a misleading name
	* `time_spent_per_pr` or `time_spent_on_pr` would be better
